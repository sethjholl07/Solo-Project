# Solo-Project

1. Identify your user(s):
People who enjoy online shopping for clothes
2. What is the problem youâ€™re solving?
Not being able to visualize the separate pieces you chose when shopping (ex. shirt, pants, shoes, hats, sunglasses) into one cohesive outfit. 
3. What is the solution?
When picking out separate pieces you can drag and drop (?) the images into my application, and it will generate the full outfit for you to visualize. 
4. What is the MVP scope? (core features you must get working)
Minimum would be being able to drag and drop pants and a shirt. 
5. What are the tough technical challenges involved with solving this problem?
I think the biggest technical challenge I will run into is being able to figure out how to add the image I find from another website into my application - also the scaling of images can pose a challenge. 
6. What are the stretch goals?
Being able to add functionality for shoes, hats, sunglasses, accessories, etc.
